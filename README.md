## About

Librarians can create an engaging quiz based on some of the most iconic books on their shelves.

* Every 15 minutes, your TRMNL will display the opening line of a popular book. 
* Four choices are shown - including the name of the book and the author.
* After 10 minutes, the answer is shown by displaying the book cover.
* Five minutes later, a different book's opening line is displayed.

This sample plugin contains nearly one-hundred different books.  More can be added to suit the needs of your library or collection.

## How it works

The file `generator.php` contains a list of books, opening lines, authors, and cover images.

Every time the generator webpage is requested, it randomly selects four books.  It then creates a JSON document which contains all the information needed to run the quiz.

## Adding new books

In the file `generator.php` you will see a variable called `$books` - it is an array which holds all the books' information.

A book entry looks like:

```php
[
	"title"=>"Moby Dick", 
    "line"=>"Call me Ishmael.",
	"author"=>"Herman Melville", 
    "cover"=>"moby-dick-collins-classics.webp"
],
```

You can add new entries by copying that text, adding it to the end of the array, and saving it.

You will need a uniquely-named book cover image. Images can be JPEG, PNG, or WebP files. Save the file in the `covers` directory.
